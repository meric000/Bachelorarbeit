"a" + "<||>" %3D" b||w||r||y||k||g
(used to select an aspect of a card – aspects can be combined arbitrarily)
(<,> influence which cards are included in the search: > searches for cards with exactly one of these aspects, < includes cards with some of the chosen aspects or also colorless cards, if omitted it searches for cards with only these aspects)

"+"
"%28r%3" + "Ac || Au || Ar || Al || As"
"+%29"
(filter by card rarity; when searching for multiple rarities they are combined as follows:
%28r%3Ac+OR+r%3Au+OR+r%3Ar+OR+r%3Al+OR+r%3As+%29 → %28r%ABBREV0+OR+r%3ABBREV1+OR+r%3ABBREV2...)

"+"
"$name"
(the name of the card being searched for – partial strings also count as matches.
Example: with the string "Vader" cards with "InVADERs" will also appear as results)

"+"
"arena%3A" + "Ground || Space"
(search for a card that acts either on the ground or in space)

"+"
"tr%3A" +
"BOUNTY HUNTER || CAPITAL SHIP || CLONE || CONDITION ||

(search for the type of the card and its function in the game)

"+"

"+"
"c||p||h" + "%3DNum (=) ||<Num || ||>Num || %21%3DNum (!=)||>%3DNum(>=)||<%3DNum(<=)"
(filter for card stats. When searching with multiple values, they are combined as follows:
h%21%3D10+c<10+p>10 → hp!=10, cost<10, power>10)

"+"
"sort=" + "name || type || arenas || aspects || power || hp || cost || traits || rairty || setnumber || artist"
(defines how the cards are sorted)

"+"
"sort_order=" "asc||desc"
